# DECIDE
Repository for assignment #1 "DECIDE" in DD2480. DECIDE is a function that takes in a bunch of parameters corresponding to radar readings and will decide if interceptors should be launched.

# Instructions
This project is written in Java and uses Gradle as the build tool.  
  
To build and run
Install Gradle according to [this guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_java_applications.html) and the Java JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). We can only guarantee support for Gradle v7.6 and Java version 19, although it would likely work with different versions of Java.  

After installing Gradle and Java download the repository and open a terminal or command prompt. Use **cd** to change directory to the same one where the **gradlew.bat** file is. Run, bundle or test the program by using the gradlew tool. Platform specific commands are listed below.

**Linux/OSX:**  
- **Run without bundling:** ./gradlew run  
- **Bundle application:** ./gradlew build  
- **Test application:** ./gradlew test  
  
**Windows:** 
- **Run without bundling:** gradlew run  
- **Bundle application:** gradlew build  
- **Test application:** gradlew test
